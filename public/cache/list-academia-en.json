It remains possible for members of each to instance to interact with others.\r\nThere is no monopoly by a single commercial company, no ads, and no tracking.\r\n\r\nWe aim to help activism/campaigning groups to make this step now.\r\nhttps://campaign.openworlds.info\r\nhttps://activism.openworlds.info","topic":"Campaigning and NGO groups working for a better world","languages":["en"],"other_languages_accepted":true,"federates_with":null,"prohibited_content":["nudity_nocw","pornography_all","spam","advertising"],"categories":["academia","activism","journalism","tech"]},"thumbnail":"https://campaign.openworlds.info/packs/preview-9a17d32fc48369e8ccd910a75260e67d.jpg","thumbnail_proxy":"https://camo.instances.social/e109c5f1aca2396a07b75f404301159ae5a0ab96/68747470733a2f2f63616d706169676e2e6f70656e776f726c64732e696e666f2f7061636b732f707265766965772d39613137643332666334383336396538636364393130613735323630653637642e6a7067","active_users":7},{"id":"5a8bf1c31496030bf4c7a98e","name":"medsos.web.id","added_at":"2018-02-20T10:00:35.325Z","updated_at":"2018-03-24T12:54:40.652Z","checked_at":"2018-03-24T13:43:36.994Z","uptime":0.9901568748077515,"up":true,"dead":false,"version":"2.3.1","ipv6":false,"https_score":null,"https_rank":null,"obs_score":50,"obs_rank":"C","users":12,"statuses":212,"connections":341,"open_registrations":true,"info":{"short_description":"Mastodon Instance for fun.

I can't even express how angry this makes me.\" \r\n- an activist group using Facebook. People and organisations who feel this way are our initial targets.\r\n\r\nWe are launching two new Mastodon instances for activists and campaigners to aid communication of grassroot groups; putting social media back in our hands by providing a free, unfettered home for campaigners, NGO’s and activists to communicate among their peers and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis project is a way out of the restricted, algorithmic, for-profit mediation and commercialisation of communication we increasingly experience. If you do not pay to \"boost\" each post, a Facebook page will only reach 3-6% of members. This soon becomes an expensive drain on limited NGO and activist budgets. \r\nActivists and campaigners alike are ready to shift their outreach away from the corporate social networks paid-per-view “walled gardens”.\r\n\r\nMastodon is the worlds largest free open source decentralised microblogging network; it’s thousands of unique, interconnected communities, filled with different people, interests, languages, and needs. \r\nYou’re free to join any community you like, or better yet, host your own, on your own terms. It remains possible for members of each to instance to interact with others. \r\nThere is no monopoly by a single commercial company, no ads, and no tracking.\r\n\r\nWe aim to help activism/campaigning groups to make this step now.\r\n\r\nhttps://campaign.openworlds.info \r\nhttps://activism.openworlds.info","topic":" Its an unfettered space for Activists and groups to communicate via #openweb projects.","languages":["en"],"other_languages_accepted":true,"federates_with":null,"prohibited_content":["nudity_nocw","pornography_nocw","spam","advertising"],"categories":["academia","activism","journalism","tech"]},"thumbnail":"https://activism.openworlds.info/packs/preview-9a17d32fc48369e8ccd910a75260e67d.jpg","thumbnail_proxy":"https://camo.instances.social/a581106865f541d311d29653fc187829b28bb9d4/68747470733a2f2f616374697669736d2e6f70656e776f726c64732e696e666f2f7061636b732f707265766965772d39613137643332666334383336396538636364393130613735323630653637642e6a7067","active_users":2}],"pagination":{"total":12}}
